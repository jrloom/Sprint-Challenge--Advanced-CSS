1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive layout changes based on defined breakpoints for various screen sizes (eg desktop, tablet, mobile). A fully responsive layout is more dynamic,making changes to the layout as the content breaks regardless of device.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

In mobile first, you start the design for mobile devices, adding elements as the screen sizes grow. In desktop first, you start the design for desktop, subtracting elements as the screen sizes shrink.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

Sets the root font-size to 10px (10/16 = 62.5% = 10px = 1rem).

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

A CSS preprocessor is a way to include logic in CSS. It lets us use variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, and so makes writing CSS easier and quicker. The code can also be reused.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I liked the variables because you can control a whole bunch of stuff across the code. I'm starting to really like mixins. The most trouble I've had, I guess, is figuring when and where to use a mixin - to get the sweetspot of not too little/not too much.
